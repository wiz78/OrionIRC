  IMPORTANT: I've began adding scripting support to Orion. It will
  ---------- actually be very cool, but (big "but" :) I need help to
             make it accessible: i.e. I need some volunteers to write
             the documentation. Also, one or two scripters who would
             like to help with beta-testing and suggestions are welcome.
             If you wish to collaborate, write to <orion@tellini.info>


Version 1.8
-----------

 - Fixed parsing of commands entered with too many spaces between the
   arguments (e.g. "/SERVER    irc.foo.bar" didn't work).

 - URL Catcher: fixed error when loading saved URL's containing an empty
   address field.


Version 1.7
-----------

- When using /QUERY, a /WHO is performed to get the right capitalization
  of the nick to set in the query caption and log name (of course, it only
  works if the server supports /WHO ;-)
- "Flash status bar button" didn't work for DCC chat sessions. Fixed.
- Added the "Server->Channel list..." menu item.
- Added /LIST command.
- Added option to sort the tab bar by several criteria.

  of the windows will be shown in the tab bar.

Version 1.6
-----------

- Half-Ops are recognized. They will be marked by a half-green,
  half-yellow dot.

  considered the same, thus only the first will be saved.

- Made the default hostmask used by /ignore more precise.
- Ignore list: hostmasks added via /ignore or using the context menu
  weren't saved unless you opened and closed the Ignore window. Fixed.

  correctly.

- Input box: pressing Home, End, Ctrl, Shift or Alt while navigating
  through the history list won't restart from the last typed entry.
- Input box: when pasting several lines, they will be added to the history
  list.
- Input box: entering the first character of the channel name (eg. #) and
  pressing Tab will complete it (if you're in a channel, of course).
- PRIVMSG's sent to unknown targets (e.g. @#channel, +#channel or anything
  else which may arrive) are not discarded.
- Query window: fixed access violation which could happen after terminating
  a DCC Chat session.

  (bold, italic) for events.

  message, its icon will blink.

  only on NTFS partitions and only for certain file types.
- Options: sounds can be configured for certain events.
- Pressing PageUp/PageDown in windows scrolls buffer up/down.
- Input box: ESC clears the text.

  running Unreal IRCd).

  (joins, parts...) which can be a nuisance on large channels.

  initial /WHO of the channel wasn't hidden. Fixed.

  certain conditions.

  when loading the catched URL's on startup.

  when closing the program.

  /SERVER command.
- Implemented the code behind the "Ignore" button in the DCC Chat request
  window. It had no effect whatsoever so far. Whoops.

- Server settings weren't applied if reconnecting with the "Switch server"
  button.
- Fixed hotspots not working correctly with control codes (i.e. you could
  see a "Click here to..." hint misplaced respect the corresponding URL or
  channel name if the line had colours in it).

- Finished the Ignore menu item on the user list and the
  Ignore button in query windows.
- Auto-rejoin works even when kicked from a keyword protected
  channel.
- /nick now passes extra parameters to the server (useful to
  send /nick <nick> <pwd> on Unreal ircd servers).
- Fixed the URL catcher not to eat an awful lot of CPU cycles
  on certain complex URL's.
- Added option to ask for comfirmation before quitting.
- Server messages parsing now accepts '\n' too instead of '\r\n' as
  line terminator, thus avoiding problems with servers which don't
  comply strictly with the IRC RFC (Irssi proxy, for one).
- Small fixes here and there.
