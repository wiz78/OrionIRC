                                    Orion
                                   -------

Orion is a simple, yet complete IRC client. 

I've developed it since none of the other IRC clients I've tried completely 
fulfilled my needs.

At the moment, there isn't a lot of documentation about the program (none at all,
actually :-) as I prefer to spend the spare time I can dedicate to Orion writing
code instead of docs, so please bear with me. 

If anyone wishes to contribute by writing docs, feel free to drop me a mail.
