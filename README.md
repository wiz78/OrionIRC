# OrionIRC

Orion is a compact, yet comfortable IRC client for Windows.

Written mainly to satisfy my needs, Orion has already reached a good maturity level, offering all the most important features you would expect from an IRC client plus some extra goodies that few have.

Since I haven’t had time to dedicate to this project in more than 10 years, it’s now available under a Creative Commons license, so that other might decide to work on it. The sources can be ported with some tweaks to Turbo C++ Express, the free development IDE from Borland (if it still exists ;-)
